Hi, I'm Brian Mueller.

I am a teacher and Software Engineering Coordinator at the High School of Telecommunication Arts and Technology. As a part of our **Web Design** curriculum, this site was developed as an examplar project where students learn front-end web development (HTML/CSS) coupled with their own learning of a front-end tool. In this case, I am using Jekyll, a static site generator, to allow professionals from various industries to contribute the connections to CS in their jobs by using simple markdown syntax. Jekyll then does the rest!
